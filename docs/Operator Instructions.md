# Roses Graphics

 ## General
 General gives you access to control the RosesLive logo, and the 'bug' in the top left.
 'Bug' refers to the clock and 'Live' display. It can also show locations.

 ## Lower Thirds
 These are the things which appear at the bottom of the screen, often used to show people's names when being interviewed.
 Filling in the boxes at the top of the page lets you create a list of lower thirds, ready to quickly play. You can either show them on the left or right (for example, if you had two guests) or have it fill the width of the screen.

 The GREEN buttons SHOW the lower third. The RED buttons HIDE them. The 'X' deletes the lower third from your list, so you'd have to retype it to use it again.

 The system will let you put lower thirds of different types over eachother. Don't do this!

 ## Grid
 The grid is fairly left-explainatory. Note, though, that empty rows will upset the spacing of the columns. Don't leave empty rows!
 To reset the colours, just click the 'X' in the corner of the colour picker.

 ## Roses
 This displays the overall Roses points. It uses the internet to get the score fro roseslive.co.uk. If that website goes down, turn on 'Manual Score' and it will let you input the score manually.
 If the system checks roseslive.co.uk and the score has changed, it'll change it, even if the graphic is on air.

 ## Boxing
 #### Rounds
 The dropdown box chooses the round. This is displayed on the graphic. NOTE adding or removing the clock is a 'snap' animation, it's not very pretty!
 The textboxes can be used to add more text to the graphic, such as surname, or corner colour.
 #### Clock
 The clock is started AND stopped using the pause button. The reset button sets the clock to 0 but does NOT stop it. The up arrow makes the clock count up, the down arrow makes it a countdown timer. If the clock isn't working, make sure it's set to go up, not down!

 ## Football
 #### Score bar
 The score is simple. It shows time, and the score.
 #### Pre/Post match bar
This is more complex - the 'top' and 'bottom' text fields need to be set up BEFORE the graphic is switched on.
 #### Teams and Setting
This is a feature for the future...

 ## Rugby
Yet to get working

 ## Darts
 #### Score graphic
 The score graphic is simple - the text boxes let you change the title and team names.
 #### scoring
 Darts is scored as the first to reach 0, where the score they throw is subtracted from a starting value of 501.
 Example: If Lancaster throw "26" in their first throw, type '26' in score and hit take. This will calculate their current score.
 If you take away too many, you can 'add' score by typing in negative numbers.
 When a player reaches a score of 0, they get a leg. When they get to 3 legs, they get a set point.

 ## Swimming
 #### clock
 The clock for swimming is simple - the text box controls what else is shown on the graphic (eg '100M Men's Firsts')
 The red arrow puts the clock in 'count up' mode. If it isn't working, try clicking that!
 The pause button is also the start button. To reset, make sure the clock is first paused!
 #### Lanes
 You can enter swimmers names and teams in the table.
 When swimmers finish, type the number of their lane into the 'Order' box. This is used in two ways
 #### Splits
 This shows the 3 swimmers in first-third places. This is particularly useful at mid points of races. Obviously, the time shown is only as accurate as when the first number was pressed! It's a small graphic in the corner of the screen.
 #### Start/Result
 This displays a table of swimmer's names. If the order box is filled in, it shows them in that order (so the order they finished)

 ## Basketball
 #### Clock
 The clock on the score bar is controlled on the page. The red button makes the clock count up, and the green button makes it a countdown timer. If your clock says 0 and isn't working, try pressing the red button!
 The pause button is also the start button. Before resetting the clock, make sure it's paused.
 #### Score
 The score starts empty. Click '+1' then '-1' to start from 0

 ## Archery
 #### not in use because the scoring system isn't the same as the one used in roses.

 ## Badminton
 #### Scoring
 Badminton is scored as 'first to 21 if you also have a two point lead'. The person who scores the 30th point wins, if it gets that far. It's best of 3 games.
 To use the graphics, it is recommended to HIDE the score when you change the Game counter and reset the POINTS counter. This is just to hide the jumpiness!

 ## Tennis
 #### Scoring
 Scoring is incredibly simple for tennis - just fill out the player names, select who is serving first, then just incremement the scores using the plus signs. The graphics server will (hopefully) figure out all complicated scoring rules, including tiebreaks.
